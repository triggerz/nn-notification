 - Title: Who to ask to take an extra shift?
 - Image: http://res.cloudinary.com/dertn65o7/image/upload/v1522013776/dilemma_who_to_ask_extra_shift.jpg

# Description

There is a flu going round, and you just received a message that Joan will not be coming in tomorrow morning. If you cannot find a replacement, the monthly production targets are at risk of not being met, as the lack of hands is likely to slow down the production. But: You have already asked around, and no-one wants to take the shift. There is no way around it: You have to go back and ask one who have already turned you down the first time you asked. Who will you contact next?

# Choice
Lilly? She is always very helpful. However, when you her asked the first time, she replied that she had already taken on two extra shifts in the past 3 weeks, so she did not want to take another one, but you have a feeling that you could talk her into it.

# Variables
 - yourself-aware-ownemotions: 0.2
 - rolemodel-setdirection-balance: 0.7
 - rolemodel-decisions-competition: 0.3

# Feedback
You probably picked Lilly because you sensed that she would save yes, and that would solve your problem. The problem is that you often end up asking the same few people. And that make your most flexible people feel misused. 

# Choice
Jonas? When you him asked the first time, he really wanted to help, but couldn't because he had promised to drive his son to the dentist tomorrow.

# Variables
 - yourself-aware-ownemotions: 0.6
 - rolemodel-setdirection-balance: 0.7
 - rolemodel-decisions-competition: 0.5

# Feedback
You decided to try with Jonas. (maybe someone else could have taken the trip to the dentist?). Many would have asked Lilly first, because they sensed that she would save yes, and that would solve your problem. As you know, the problem is that you often end up asking the same few people. And that make your most flexible people feel misused. You made a good call! 

# Choice
No-one? Though it's likely to cost a lower output tomorrow, this is what happens from time to time.

# Variables
 - yourself-aware-ownemotions: 0.1
 - rolemodel-setdirection-balance: 0.2
 - rolemodel-decisions-competition: 0.1

# Feedback
You gave up too early! That option must be reserved to cases where there are really no more options available.
